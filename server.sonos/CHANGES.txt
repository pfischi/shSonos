        read the documentation

    --  sonos broker should no stop reliable
    --  minor bug fixes in documentation

v0.3

    --  !! ATTENTION !!: commands are changed to JSON commands. They are more flexible
        than the old HTTP GET commands.
        Please adapt your clients to this new feature. Older clients won't work.
        Please read the manual to set it up and get some example implementations.
        If you're running the Broker together with the Smarthome.py framework,
        make sure you use the newest Sonos plugin.

        commands by adding 'group_command: 1' to the json command structure

    --  !! to get the current track position, poll GetTrackInfo with 'force_refresh' option
        (see documentation)

        position; use GetTrackInfo instead
    --  the Broker now sends only the current changed speaker values instead of the whole
