[webservice]

# Sonos Broker can start an own webservice that delivers stored audio files to the Sonos speakers. This is helpful for
# playing audio snippets and the Google TTS functionality. E.g. every audio snippet under 'root_path' can be played via
# 'play_snippet' command.
# You can leave this option disabled if you're using another webserver (nginx, apache) or you don't want to use Google
# TTS and/or the snippet command with local audio files. You can place all your snippet audio files in the web
# root directory. The server handles these files by their extension. Valid extensions are: aac, mp4, mp3, ogg, wav, web.
# This does not mean that the Sonos speakers can playback such a file.
# Port and IP address are the same as the values 'host' and 'port' in the [sonos_broker] section.

# Enables the webservice. Default: false
# enabled = false

# Web-root path. The directory must exists and readable (better writeable) for the current user. Default: /var/www
# root_path = /var/www
